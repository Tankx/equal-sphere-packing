# Equal-sphere-packing

A very basic python script to find the coordinates of spheres packed in a box (rectangular prism). 

The main motivation behind this code is to identify strategies to pack spherical fruit in carton at higher densities. Specifically, thin trays are placed in between the fruit layers (inside the cartons) to maintain a certain packing configuration.

The first method was written to emulate the technique used in apple packhouses, basically it is face centered close packing..

HCP:
hexagonal close packing
